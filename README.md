# Editor

A C# game editor.

As of now it contains a scene window, entity view, file register, and a render window.
All engine functionallity is invoked from dlls created in C++.

# Dependencies

* Renderer
* Entity Component System
* Resource Handler

# Build
If using Visual Studio (2017) just get each dependency so that they are located in the same folder then you should only need to press build.

If not using Visual Studio I wish you the best of luck.
